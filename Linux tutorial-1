RHCSA  (Red Hat Certified System Administrator):

RHCSA I (Paper code --RH124) for normal linux admin, Fee- $400
RHCSA II (Paper code -- RH135) For some high level

Linux uses genome i.e, Terminal not Konsole 
bash- Bourne shell

vi/vim is a text editor
When we open terminal then the path which is opened: /etc/profile

After profile.d then bash profile runs in existing user home directory (vi .bash_profile)
then .bashhrc runs -> vi /etc/bashrc

Every user is login in bash shell..

# Set the password for root :
  passwd root👉️

# Login through root :
   su -👉️

#  To add the user:
   adduser bhati-ji👉️ (user name)  (but it will not work untill we will not create password for this user)
   set the password and the other details:

# To set the password 

# To check the no. of users in the system:
  ls /home👉️

# To delete the any user:

  userdel -r bhati-ji (user_name)👉️ -> It will delete all the details included gmail and all other details because we are deleting this user in a recurssive manner

# If we want to change the showing user directory i.e, from /home to anyone like /home/admin
  
  mkdir /home/admin
  useradd -c "vijay" -d /home/admin/vijay vijay

 when we do ls /home/admin
   -> vijay

# If we want that any user not able to login then 
   passwd -l vijay (-l for locak


# To login with any user of the system:
  su - clixlogix (user name)

# To lock and unlock any user:

  To lock:passwd -l test(user name)
  To unlock : passwd -u test(user name)

# To set the limitations on user password to change his password within 90/.. days

  chage -M 90 test(user name)

# To send the pre-notifications to user to change his password before password expiration in 3 days:
  chage -W 3 test  (W for warning)

# To check the user policies activated for the particular user:
  chage -l test (user name)

# To set the password expiration date:
   chage -E 2020-10-05 test

# Where all the user and their passwords details are saved in system ?
   less /etc/passwd

# User passwords are saved in encrypted form :
   less /etc/shadow

# When we create any user then by default a local group also created and that group is called primary group and location is:
  less /etc/group

# To reboot system through cmd:
   reboot

#  To shut down system through cmd:
   init 0 / shutdown -r +5 (it means system will shutdown after5 minutes)

$  To stop this shutdown :
   shutdown -c (c for cancel)
