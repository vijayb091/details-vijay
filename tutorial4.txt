Aim: 
i) Allocate additional permissions
ii) Create partition, file system, mount partition
iii) Create swap partition
iv) Apply Access Control List on files and folders
v) Encrypt file system
vi) Compress files

So, first we learn how to give additional permissions..

Our all passwords bydefault save in /etc/shadow file... 
and all the filepermissions is stored in /etc/sudoers  file..

Let suppose i am login as a local user and try to view the content of the permission from file using cat /etc/sudoers
then it will show permission denied so we have to use sudo to run this command to avoid the error..
So, we will learn how to give all permissions to local user like root user..

First, we will run this command from root user to give all the priviliges to the local user..
so do,   vi /etc/sudoers then it will the show the permissions provided to the root user so we can here give the same permissions to the local user..like 
root               ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
clixlogix-vijay    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

But we will not try to make any changes by this way because if we will make any changes through this way then it may affect the system. 

So we will use 'visudo' to make any changes i.e,  visudo
and then we will do changes after root to local user..
